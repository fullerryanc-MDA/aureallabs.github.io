```

cp index.html styles.css script.js CNAME README.md /path/to/aureallabs.github.io/
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
# Navigate to repository
cd aureallabs.github.io

git add index.html styles.css script.js CNAME README.md

git commit -m "v2.0: Mission-focused redesign - responsible discovery companion"

# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Configure DNS Records

#### In Zoho Mail (or your domain registrar):

**Required DNS Records:**

   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Host: www
   Value: fullerryanc-mda.github.io
   TTL: 3600
   ```

2. **A Records** (for root domain - add all 4):
   ```
   Type: A
   Host: @ (or blank/root)
   
   Values (create 4 separate A records):
   185.199.108.153
   185.199.109.153
   185.199.110.153
   185.199.111.153

   ```
